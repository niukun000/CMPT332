we will start by testing create lists

create first list and check if its been created by checking the return value;

if list is been sucessfully created
continue to create lists to check the maxnumber of lists we can create is the same as our boundry
then we check if we can insert an item into the empty list 
then insert into a list with 1 or more items,
then try to insert to list head of a list with 1 or more items
then insert to list tail of a list with 1 or more items

we do same checkings for all other operations;
