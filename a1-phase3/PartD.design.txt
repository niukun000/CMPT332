We create a custom system call named numprocs(). 
In order to do this we define SYS_numprocs 22 in syscall.h, make changes in syscall.c,
and add int numprocs(void) in user.h. We use struct defined in proc.c instead of sysproc.c,
and define a counter to track how many current process has RUNNABLE state. Also, for our
test numprocs, we use fork twice to create child processes, and let it print current
runnable processes to check our numproc() system call function.
